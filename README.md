In my understanding, MacOS 15.1 has created a [code signing](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/finder-does-not-have-permission-to-open-null.2441374/) issue with apps not "approved" by Apple.

While no fix is provided, I have made my own automatized launchers that are release agnostic and can be used to build "app" files with Automator.
